          The <strong>humblCOMPASS</strong> is the center-piece of our

          <strong>GROWTH</strong> and <strong>INFLATION</strong> data of any
          country to determine the current regime. These two data points have
          the most influence on the economy.

        <p>
          Depending on the direction of <strong>GROWTH</strong> and{' '}

          The <strong>humblCHANNEL</strong> is used as a quantitative signal to
          determine the best time to enter or exit a position. It is not
          guaranteed that assets that have outperformed in a particular regime
          will continue to do so in the future, so we use this signal to ensure
          that the asset we want to invest in is still in a good position to
          buy, or sell.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {/* reword spitting out buy and sell price */}
          The beauty of the <strong>humblCHANNEL</strong> is that it can be used
          on <strong>any asset</strong> as long as there is a time series
          available for it. It spits out a buy and sell price for any asset and
          is built upon robust mathematics. No opinions. It can be used to help
          investors judge the best time to buy or sell an asset on any time
          frame that they choose. Want to do some day trading? Shrink the
          humblCHANNEL window and get a narrower price channel. Do you like to
          make some swing trades and only look at your portfolio every couple of
          weeks or months? Adjust the parameters accordingly, and the
          humblCHANNEL will widen to accommodate a longer-term outlook.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our humblSTRATEGY has suggested time frames to consider, but your
          money is yours so we allow you to change the algorithm to suit your
          needs, no questions asked.

          The humblSTRATEGY is based on a secretive methodology used by major
          Wall Street institutions to navigate the US stock market. They do this
          by measuring and understanding the health of the economy and
          identifying the most profitable assets across all economic scenarios.
          This approach goes beyond traditional &quot;stocks vs. cash vs.
          bonds&quot; thinking, allowing investors to optimize their portfolio
          for both growth and protection during all economic conditions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After four years of extensive research; reading academic papers and
          sifting through economic data, we&apos;ve developed the humblSTRATEGY
          to make this institutional-level approach accessible to individual
          investors. Our goal is to provide a simple, user-friendly interface
          that helps you understand and navigate economic health indicators,
          empowering you to make informed investment decisions in any market
          condition.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our strategy provides guidance on what to invest in during different
          economic phases, including periods of expansion, contraction,
          inflation, and deflation. It helps you maintain the value of your
          investments even when traditional &quot;safe&quot; options like bank
          deposits may be losing purchasing power due to inflation.
